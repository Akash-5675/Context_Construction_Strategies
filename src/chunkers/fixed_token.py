"""
Fixed-token chunker — Phase 3.1.

Splits text into chunks of exactly `chunk_size` words with a configurable
word overlap. Produces 12 conditions: 3 sizes (128/256/512) × 4 overlaps
(0 / 10 / 20 / 40 percent of chunk_size).

The condition key format is: fixed_{size}_{overlap_pct}pct
  e.g. fixed_256_20pct
